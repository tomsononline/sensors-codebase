# Sensor Codebase

This repository contains example files for a variety of sensors, showing how to set up and operate them using platforms such as Arduino and STM32.

## Structure

- `sensors/`: Each sensor has its own folder, with example code for different platforms.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and contribution guidelines.

## How to Use

- Browse to the sensor youâ€™re interested in (`sensors/SensorName/`).
- Pick your platform (`arduino/`, `stm32/`, etc.).
- Use or adapt the example files for your own project.

## Contributing
